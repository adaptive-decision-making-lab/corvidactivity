  abstract = {Two commercial strains, Hy-Line W-36 and DeKalb XL, were moved to a laying house at 18 wk of age. They were housed 6 hens/layer cage at 2 densities (361 and 482 cm2/bird) with 2 replications each per strain/density combination. The high-density treatment contained 24 hens/replication and the low-density treatment contained 18 hens/replication for a total of 168 hens. Production parameters were measured during the first egg production cycle, the molt period, and the first 4 wk of the second lay cycle (20 to 68 wk of age). Behavioral observations were taken during 2 consecutive d at 26, 34, 43, 51, 62, 64, and 68 wk of age to examine behavioral patterns. Modified Hansen's tests were conducted concurrently to provide indication of the fearfulness levels of hens at the various stages of production. The production characteristics were similar for both strains. The hens kept at the higher density had lower (P {$<$} 0.01) hen-day production and (P {$<$} 0.05) daily egg mass. Appetitive behaviors were not affected by strain or density but were affected by the age of the hen and by molting. During the molt, feeding and drinking behavioral acts were fewer (P {$<$} 0.05) at 0.018 and 0.013 acts per bird/min, respectively, and standing behavior was highest. The results indicated that the frequencies of pecking inedible objects during the molt period were similar to the frequencies at 26 and 34 wk. Hens performed more acts of standing, and crouching and had lower frequency of movement during the molt. Those kept at a low density performed more movement acts. Feather pecking decreased as hens aged and increased when they molted but was not affected by strain or density. The frequency of aggression and submissive acts was significantly lower during the molt period. Behaviors were affected by strain, density, bird age, and molting; however, the patterns and number of aggressive acts did not increase to compromise the welfare status of the hens. Behaviors during the molt appeared consistent with mechanisms for conservation of body reserves.},

  abstract = {The ultimate factors influencing age-specific reproductive performance in birds have been widely discussed, and several hypotheses have been suggested to explain why young/inexperienced breeders have lower reproductive success than older individuals. In comparison, proximate factors and, particularly, hormonal mechanisms influencing age-related reproductive performance have received lesser attention. In this paper, we examined how baseline levels of corticosterone and prolactin, two hormones involved in reproduction, changed with age and experience in a long-lived bird, the Black-browed albatross (Thallasarche melanophris) during the brooding stage. Corticosterone levels were not linked to age, whereas prolactin levels increased until individuals reached 15~years of age. First-time breeders had higher corticosterone levels and lower prolactin levels than experienced ones. Corticosterone levels were not correlated with breeding experience among experienced birds, whereas prolactin levels slightly increased with advancing experience. Among experienced breeders, there was no effect of individual quality on corticosterone and prolactin levels. Baseline corticosterone and prolactin levels were respectively, positively and negatively correlated to time spent fasting/brooding on the nest. Moreover, the probability of successfully fledging a chick was negatively related to corticosterone levels, but not to prolactin levels. Elevated corticosterone levels in first time breeders may serve as evidence for depleted body reserves resulting from lower foraging/brooding capabilities and therefore support the constraint hypothesis. Low prolactin levels in young/inexperienced birds may be interpreted either as evidence for their lower breeding capacities (constraint hypothesis) or for their limited breeding investment (restraint hypothesis). Finally, we report, for the first time, the hormonal changes associated with the onset of senescence. The very old and most experienced birds, which had the lowest probability of successfully fledging a young, displayed elevated corticosterone levels and low prolactin levels, possibly indicating a degradation of breeding skills and/or a disruption of the endocrine system in senescent birds.},

Environmental refinement can be defined as any modification in the environment of captive animals that seeks to enhance the physical and psychological well-being of the animals by providing stimuli which meet the animals' species-specific needs. This article provides an overview of environmental factors that influence the well-being of captive animals with specific reference to the needs of the most common laboratory species. It is important to evaluate environmental refinement in terms of the benefit to the animal, by assessing the use of and preference for certain enrichment, the effect on behaviour, and the performance of species-typical behaviour on physiological parameters. It is also necessary to evaluate the impact of refinement on scientific outcome, including whether and how statistical power is affected. Communication and team work between animal welfare scientists, animal research scientists, institutional animal welfare officers, veterinarians and animal ethics committees, animal facility management and personnel, are essential for success.},

  abstract = {Birds respond to the perception of potentially noxious stimuli by activating the adrenocortical response to stress. The resulting elevation of circulating corticosterone (the predominant avian ``stress hormone'') promotes highly adaptive physiological and behavioral changes aimed at coping with stress, redirecting the individual into a survival mode while suppressing non-essential activities. However, corticosterone is also required at low levels in the circulation for basic physiological processes, and it plays a fundamental role in the regulation of body energy balance regardless of exposure to stress. Furthermore, high and prolonged elevations like those occurring during chronic adverse conditions exert deleterious effects on critical body systems. The ambiguity of the concept of stress, and the fact that the same hormone exerts opposing (``good and bad'') actions depending on its level, has led to the recent development of novel conceptual frameworks. These are aimed at integrating the energy requirements of birds across their lifecycles with the adrenocortical response, and also at explaining the role of corticosterone in ``allostasis'', the maintenance of homeostasis through change, a term gradually replacing the word ``stress''. The Allostasis Model and the Reactive Scope Model are recent paradigms to understand allostasis in wild animals, with a vast potential for testable predictions in wild birds. The two models will be explained in the first section of this chapter, with an updated classification of the nomenclature describing corticosterone levels and actions. Avian endocrine and behavioral responses are dramatically different when facing predictable versus unpredictable environmental change (also called perturbations or stressors). Why, when, and how environmental conditions promote an activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis will be addressed in a second section, providing an updated classification of the types of perturbations. This classification takes into account the duration of the unpredictable stimuli, the associated adrenocortical response, and the resulting effects on the normal progression of an individual's lifecycles. Avian lifecycles can be temporarily or permanently disrupted in response to perturbations. Although short-term elevations of circulating corticosterone activate a highly adaptive ``emergency life history stage'', longer exposures disrupt lifecycles, potentially leading to individual deaths and population extinction. However, the adrenocortical response shows all the features of a trait subjected to natural selection (high individual variation, repeatability, and a genetic basis), and individuals display a strong phenotypic plasticity that may allow differential survival of stress-tolerant individuals. Several examples of the adaptive variability in the adrenocortical response will be provided in a third section. For example, avian developmental modes range across a spectrum of altricial and precocial species, and the adrenocortical response at hatching and during growth increases across this gradient. This pattern has likely evolved to balance the costs and benefits of corticosterone actions with the ability of young birds to cope with perturbations without parental support. Corticosterone can be also transferred from mothers to offspring. This process has been termed ``maternal programming'', and has the potential to translate ecological and environmental conditions into permanent offspring responses, resulting in phenotypes better adapted to cope with perturbations. Adult birds of many avian species have been shown to modulate their adrenocortical response during reproduction and according to the value of their brood. These findings suggest that modulation of corticosterone secretion allows a trade-off of energy and resources between current reproductive investment and survival, providing a proximate (corticosterone-mediated) mechanism for life history evolution. Many of these findings and hypotheses result from field research using wild avian species, which imposes important challenges compared to laboratory studies. These will be addressed in the last section, with a description of common methodological tools for assessing adrenocortical function in wild birds.},

When the task is fully acquired, reward contingencies are reversed, requiring the subject to relearn the altered associations. This alternation of acquisition and reversal can be repeated many times, and the ability of a species to adapt to this regimen has been considered as an indication of behavioral flexibility. Serial reversal learning of 2-choice discriminations was contrasted in 3 related species of North American corvids: pinyon jays (Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus), which are highly social; Clark's nutcrackers (Nucifraga columbiana), which are relatively solitary but specialized for spatial memory; and western scrub jays (Aphelocoma californica), which are ecological generalists. Pinyon jays displayed significantly lower error rates than did nutcrackers or scrub jays after reversal of reward contingencies for both spatial and color stimuli. The effect was most apparent in the 1st session following each reversal and did not reflect species differences in the rate of initial discrimination learning. All 3 species improved their performance over successive reversals and showed significant transfer between color and spatial tasks, suggesting a generalized learning strategy. The results are consistent with an evolutionary association between behavioral flexibility and social complexity.},

Stereotypies may sometimes be the result of malfunctions of systems controlling behaviour but they could be used to control motivational state by increasing sensory input in monotonous surroundings or by increasing the average predictability of input in unpredictable surroundings. Their frequency of occurrence should be assessed both in the normal rearing conditions and when there is human disturbance. The effects of stereotypies on the animal's body and on the pen can also be assessed. Examples of studies where rearing condition changes have reduced the incidence of stereotypies are quoted. Whatever the function of stereotypies, if they occupy much time, say 10\% of waking life, the conditions could be said to be bad for the welfare of the animal. Stereotypy incidence, however, is just one of several measures which must be combined when assessing responses to adversity.},

The situations that result in poor welfare are reviewed in this study with special reference to those in which an individual lacks control over interactions with its environment The indicators of poor welfare include the following: reduced life expectancy, impaired growth, impaired reproduction, body damage, disease, immunosuppression, adrenal activity, behavior anomalies, and self-narcotization. The uses of measures of responsiveness, stereotypies, and animal preferences in welfare assessment are discussed. The need to make direct measurement of poor welfare as well as to use sophisticated studies of animal preferences is emphasized.}

Three principal origins of communality and altruism in birds are identified: from colonies, from a surplus of males, and by retention of young in the family, the latter being of greatest importance. The theory proposed for the evolution of communal breeding and altruism emphasizes three main processes: 1) K-selection, (2) kin selection, and (3) kin-group selection in the same chronological order.}

Indeed, behaviors that reflect an individual's personality can respond to environmental factors or change with age. To date, little is known regarding personality changes during a wild animals' lifetime and even less about stability in heritability of behavior across ages. In this study, we investigated age-related changes in the mean and in the additive genetic variance of exploratory behavior, a commonly used measure of animal personality, in a wild population of great tits. Heritability of exploration is reduced in adults compared to juveniles, with a low genetic correlation across these age classes. A random regression animal model confirmed the occurrence of genotype--age interactions (G{\texttimes}A) in exploration, causing a decrease in additive genetic variance before individuals become 1 year old, and a decline in cross-age genetic correlations between young and increasingly old individuals. Of the few studies investigating G{\texttimes}A in behaviors, this study provides rare evidence for this phenomenon in an extensively studied behavior. We indeed demonstrate that heritability and cross-age genetic correlations in this behavior are not stable over an individual's lifetime, which can affect its potential response to selection. Because G{\texttimes}A is likely to be common in behaviors and have consequences for our understanding of the evolution of animal personality, more attention should be turned to this phenomenon in the future work.},

A group of individually color-banded African Village Weavers (Ploceus cucullatus), a polygynous species, was kept in aviaries at Los Angeles for 22 years. At 14-18 years of age, old males built significantly fewer nests per year, displayed to females less often, had fewer mates, and generally fathered fewer clutches than did the same males when 9-13 years old. One male reached 24 years of age, when he rarely sang and no longer wove when provided with nest materials. The females, after reaching "middle age" (9-13 yr), laid significantly fewer eggs per year, and still fewer during "old age" (14-18 yr). When 14 or more years old, weavers of both sexes rested much more than did young adults 4-6 years old in the same aviary.Individuals differed greatly in the decline of breeding behavior with age. Some individual Village Weavers bred at a surprisingly great age for passerine birds, e.g. fertile copulations by one 19-year-old male and by one 18-year-old female. These seem to be the oldest breeding ages yet recorded for any small passerine bird. Long reproductive life of a small number of individuals that contribute disproportionately to the next generation would give a selection pressure for longevity, and also could help explain the evolution of small clutch size (2-3 eggs) in the Village Weaver and in many other tropical birds.}

Synthesizing the available scientific research and anecdotal evidence, she explores how aging affects the lives and behavior of animals ranging from elk to elephants and gulls to gorillas, examining such topics as longevity; how others in a group view senior members in regard to leadership, wisdom, and teaching; mating success; interactions with mates and offspring; how aging affects dominance; changes in aggressive behavior and adaptability; and death and dying.At once instructive and compelling, this theme-spanning book reveals the complex nature of maturity in scores of social species and shows that animal behavior often displays the same diversity we find in ourselves.``Dagg's book should be a corrective to us all; species that lose or ignore the contributions of their older members do so at their peril.'' ---Literary Review of Canada``Humans and chimps, it turns out, value age in sexual partners very differently.

Their occurrence in farm animals submitted to intensive husbandry has been interpreted to indicate inadequate environmental design or welfare. Over recent years, detailed descriptive studies have led to a better understanding of the organization and development of stereotypies, particularly in pregnant sows housed in tether stalls. Stereotyped behaviors appear to emerge from elements of initial defensive reactions of animals to their environment. They develop via a progressive narrowing of the behavioral repertoire, until only self-directed behaviors are displayed. Pharmacological studies suggest that performance of stereotyped behavior depends on the brain dopamine systems that are involved in selection and initiation of motor movements. However, generalization of these data to natural stereotypies is doubtful. Recent evidence favors an involvement of brain opioid peptides in stereotyped behavior of sows, although the exact mechanisms remain unknown. Stereotypies are typically observed in situations of conflict or frustration. They have been claimed to have an adaptive function, either by providing self-generated sensory stimulation to compensate for the lack of environmental stimulation, or by allowing animals to discharge their tension or anxiety. However, there is little evidence in favor of either interpretation. On the basis of present knowledge, it is proposed that stereotyped activities gain strength because of the positive feedback effect of sensory stimulation on their underlying control systems, which leads to a progressive sensitization of these neural systems. Stereotypies would then be simply the outward expression of an activation of lower brain structures controlling motor behavior which occurs in the absence of normal inhibitory control by higher nervous functions.},

The temporal characteristics of this behaviour and its relation to deprivation level suggest its analogy with adjunctive activities. Chain-pulling behaviour was accompanied by decreased pituitary-adrenal activity, as indicated by changes in plasma corticosteroid concentrations between the beginning and the end of the experimental session. When the opportunity to engage in chain pulling was removed, corticosteroid levels did not fall below the pre-session levels. Comparisons of animals able to engage in stereotypies with animals unable to do so because the chain had been removed showed that presession levels of plasma corticosteroids were higher in the former group than in the latter, while post-session plasma corticosteroids did not differ. In addition, the opportunity to engage in adjunctive activities did not protect the animals from the activating effects of extinction on the pituitary-adrenal axis. These data would suggest that stereotypies enable the animals to decrease excessive arousal rather than provide an extra source of stimulation.},

Evidence is accumulating that individuals from the same population differ in the degree and extent of this form of phenotypic plasticity. We here discuss how such between-individual differences in behavioural plasticity can result from additive and interactive effects of genetic make-up and past environmental conditions, and under which conditions natural selection might favour this form of between-individual variation. We highlight how spatial or temporal variation in the environment, in combination with competition among individuals, can promote adaptive individual differences in plasticity; and we detail how differences in plasticity can emerge as a result of selection pressures induced by social interactions or as a response to between-individual differences in state. We further discuss both ecological and evolutionary consequences of individual differences in plasticity. We outline, for example, how individual differences in plasticity can have knock-on effects on the rate of evolution; and how such differences can enhance the stability and persistence of populations.},

  abstract = {Many species exhibit prosocial behaviour, in which one individual's actions benefit another individual, often without an immediate benefit to itself. The neuropeptide oxytocin is an important hormonal mechanism influencing prosociality in mammals, but it is unclear whether the avian homologue mesotocin plays a similar functional role in birds. Here, we experimentally tested prosociality in pinyon jays (Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus), a highly social corvid species that spontaneously shares food with others. First, we measured prosocial preferences in a prosocial choice task with two different pay-off distributions: Prosocial trials delivered food to both the subject and either an empty cage or a partner bird, whereas Altruism trials delivered food only to an empty cage or a partner bird (none to subject). In a second experiment, we examined whether administering mesotocin influenced prosocial preferences. Compared to choices in a control condition, we show that subjects voluntarily delivered food rewards to partners, but only when also receiving food for themselves (Prosocial trials), and administration of high levels of mesotocin increased these behaviours. Thus, in birds, mesotocin seems to play a similar functional role in facilitating prosocial behaviours as oxytocin does in mammals, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved hormonal mechanism for prosociality.},

  abstract = {Food sharing offers a clear example of prosocial behaviour, in which one individual's actions benefit another. Researchers have proposed a range of hypotheses that explain why food sharing may occur among unrelated individuals. Two such hypotheses, reciprocity and dominance, have been tested in many species, including fish, corvids, rats, bats and primates, showing that (1) recipients sometimes reciprocate sharing back to previous donors and (2) dominant individuals share more than subordinates. Although primates dominate the study of prosocial behaviour, active donation of food is actually quite rare in primates. In contrast, several corvid species spontaneously share food much more frequently. Here, we explored the role of reciprocity and dominance in spontaneous food sharing among male pinyon jays, Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus, a North American corvid species that exhibits high levels of social complexity. Unlike much of the previous work, we tested prosocial behaviour among unrelated, non-pair-bonded adults. We observed high levels of active sharing, and donors showed clear preferences with whom they shared. We found no evidence that pinyon jays reciprocated shares in either the short or long term. This was true for both sharing within dyads (direct reciprocity) and sharing irrespective of most recent partner identity (generalized reciprocity). However, dominance influenced sharing in one of our squads, with dominant individuals sharing more than subordinates. This study highlights corvids as a fruitful model for the study of the proximate mechanisms underlying naturally occurring prosocial behaviours.},

Although some birds such as corvids may be intellectually comparable to apes, the same relationship between sociality and brain size seen in primates has not been found for birds, possibly suggesting a role for other non-social factors. But bird sociality is different from primate sociality. Most monkeys and apes form stable groups, whereas most birds are monogamous, and only form large flocks outside of the breeding season. Some birds form lifelong pair bonds and these species tend to have the largest brains relative to body size. Some of these species are known for their intellectual abilities (e.g. corvids and parrots), while others are not (e.g. geese and albatrosses). Although socio-ecological factors may explain some of the differences in brain size and intelligence between corvids/parrots and geese/albatrosses, we predict that the type and quality of the bonded relationship is also critical. Indeed, we present empirical evidence that rook and jackdaw partnerships resemble primate and dolphin alliances. Although social interactions within a pair may seem simple on the surface, we argue that cognition may play an important role in the maintenance of long-term relationships, something we name as 'relationship intelligence'.},

  abstract = {Lay summary:, A review that compares changes in body mass, glucocorticoid and sympathetic responses, and  reproductive and immune function, in wild animals recently introduced into captivity to their wild  counterparts. Conclusion is that captivity can be a powerful chronic stressor that may be possible to  mitigate, but the impact is highly species-specific., Wild animals are brought into captivity for many reasons---conservation, research, agriculture and the exotic pet trade. While the physical needs of animals are met in captivity, the conditions of confinement and exposure to humans can result in physiological stress. The stress response consists of the suite of hormonal and physiological reactions to help an animal survive potentially harmful stimuli. The adrenomedullary response results in increased heart rate and muscle tone (among other effects); elevated glucocorticoid (GC) hormones help to direct resources towards immediate survival. While these responses are adaptive, overexposure to stress can cause physiological problems, such as weight loss, changes to the immune system and decreased reproductive capacity. Many people who work with wild animals in captivity assume that they will eventually adjust to their new circumstances. However, captivity may have long-term or permanent impacts on physiology if the stress response is chronically activated. We reviewed the literature on the effects of introduction to captivity in wild-caught individuals on the physiological systems impacted by stress, particularly weight changes, GC regulation, adrenomedullary regulation and the immune and reproductive systems. This paper did not review studies on captive-born animals. Adjustment to captivity has been reported for some physiological systems in some species. However, for many species, permanent alterations to physiology may occur with captivity. For example, captive animals may have elevated GCs and/or reduced reproductive capacity compared to free-living animals even after months in captivity. Full adjustment to captivity may occur only in some species, and may be dependent on time of year or other variables. We discuss some of the methods that can be used to reduce chronic captivity stress.},

We found that stereotypies correlate with a sign of altered brain functioning, the general disinhibition of behaviour, found in stereotyping human patients and animals treated with psychostimulants. We investigated route-tracing stereotypy in blue tits, Parus caeruleus, and marsh tits,P.palustris , caged in a behavioural research laboratory. In experiment 1, stereotypy correlated with disinhibition of responses, shown as persistent responding in extinction learning. In experiment 2a, stereotypy in blue tits correlated with repetitive sequence generation on a `gambling task' that specifically measures disinhibited striatal functioning in humans and correlates with stereotypy in autistic and schizophrenic patients. In experiment 2b, the behavioural disinhibition correlated with stereotypy also affected food-storing behaviour in marsh tits, in particular their response to cache pilfering. In experiment 3, the sequencing of nonstereotypic home cage behaviour was correlated with stereotypy. Finally, changes in stereotypy induced by environmental enrichment correlated with changes in these measures of altered behavioural control. These results suggest that housing conditions that cause stereotypy thus alter many aspects of the behavioural control of caged subjects, mediated by altered striatal functioning. The implications for understanding cage stereotypies in laboratory, farm and zoo animals, and for laboratory-based behavioural experiments, are discussed. We suggest that improving housing conditions so that cage stereotypies do not develop would enhance the validity of laboratory-based behavioural research.},

Although neophobia is a widespread, if not universal response, of adult birds, the intensity of expression varies considerably between individuals within a species and between closely related species. It further elaborates the two hypotheses that account for adaptive variation in neophobia: the neophobia threshold hypothesis (NTH) and the dangerous niche hypothesis (DNH). This chapter states that uninhibited neophilia is commonly expressed in juvenile birds, particularly passerines. The nexus of neophilia, object play, and a high degree of motor plasticity in juveniles make this life history stage an important one to examine for the origins of innovative behaviour. This chapter conclusively states that it is likely that neophilia and neophobia can function simultaneously in adult birds, and that initial neophobia masks any attraction to novelty.},

While this is obvious, it is important to recognise that the requirements of birds and humans are fundamentally different and so there will inevitably be conflicts of interest with respect to housing and care. In some situations, human interests such as low cost, ease of cleaning and easy observation and access are unfortunately given priority over the birds' requirements. There can also be conflicts between the birds' needs; for example, the requirement for group housing in a stimulating environment can be at odds with the need to reduce the risk of disease. While a degree of compromise will always be necessary in practice, it is important to ensure that every effort is made to identify and overcome obstacles to providing birds with an interesting environment that allows them to behave normally and feel secure. Birds therefore need advocates who are willing and able to balance all of these different factors, consider husbandry from the animal's point of view and help to set up an animal-centred housing system that really will benefit the birds held within it.},

Several experiments were conducted to determine the effects of various environmental and developmental conditions on the frequency of stereotypies. Route-tracing was reduced in a very large aviary cage and when a swinging-perch arrangement was added to a smaller cage. Spot-picking was reduced when canaries were required to `work for food'. Wild-caught birds generally exhibited a greater number of route-traces and few if any spot-picks when compared to laboratory-reared birds, although the type of laboratory rearing (isolated, grouped, mother-reared, hand-reared) seemed to have little effect. It is therefore suggested that route-tracing is associated with the physical restrictions imposed on movement by the cage, while spot-picking results from some deficiency associated with laboratory conditions.},

Stereotypies were counted in 5-min observation periods excluding time spent singing, feeding, drinking, or preening. Twelve of these 5-min periods made up an experimental test series. Presentation of both novel stimuli (plastic beads and a mirror) and social stimuli (brief daily view of a bird in an adjacent cage) significantly reduced both canary stereotypies, apparently by initiating other incompatible behaviours. Grouping of birds (i.e. three birds per cage instead of one) also caused a decrease in route-tracing, but this decrease probably can be explained by the fact that the additional birds physically disrupted this stereotypy. In addition to supplying environmental stimuli to initiate alternate behaviours, the physiology of male canaries was also altered. By administering hormones or hormone analogues, which initiate reproductive behaviour and moulting, alternate behaviours were activated which significantly reduced the number of route-traces. Since canary stereotypies can be reduced by presenting the birds with opportunities to engage in alternate behaviours (by providing appropriate external or internal stimulation), these results suggest that in caged canaries, stereotypies occur primarily to supply the birds with a source of stimulation.},

This article introduces the basic concept of ICC in the content of reliability analysis. Discussion for Researchers There are 10 forms of ICCs. Because each form involves distinct assumptions in their calculation and will lead to different interpretations, researchers should explicitly specify the ICC form they used in their calculation. A thorough review of the research design is needed in selecting the appropriate form of ICC to evaluate reliability. The best practice of reporting ICC should include software information, ``model,'' ``type,'' and ``definition'' selections. Discussion for Readers When coming across an article that includes ICC, readers should first check whether information about the ICC form has been reported and if an appropriate ICC form was used. Based on the 95\% confident interval of the ICC estimate, values less than 0.5, between 0.5 and 0.75, between 0.75 and 0.9, and greater than 0.90 are indicative of poor, moderate, good, and excellent reliability, respectively. Conclusion This article provides a practical guideline for clinical researchers to choose the correct form of ICC and suggests the best practice of reporting ICC parameters in scientific publications. This article also gives readers an appreciation for what to look for when coming across ICC while reading an article.},

We review morphometric approaches (body mass, ratio and residual condition indices, predictive regression models, fat scoring, and abdominal profiles) for estimating body condition (defined as fat mass) in birds. We describe the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. Across diverse indices and species ({\textasciitilde}200 estimates total), the mean r2 relating condition indices to mass of body fat was 0.55, and 64\% of the r2 values were greater than 0.50. But despite their generally good performance, condition indices sometimes perform poorly (i.e., r2 is low). The data indicate that: (1) no single index was clearly best, (2) on average body mass alone, fat scores, and predictive multiple regression equations explained slightly more than 50\% of the variation in fat content, (3) on average, ratio and residual indices explained slightly less than 50\% of the variation in fat content, and (4) body mass alone, a variable that can be easily and reliably measured, is as good or nearly as good an indicator of fat content as any other condition index. We recommend that: (1) morphometric indicators of condition be empirically validated, (2) researchers publish their body composition data in sufficient detail that they can be used in future analyses exploring the relative merits of different condition indices, and (3) multiple regression directly on measured traits be used instead of condition indices whenever the condition index is not empirically validated.},

Comparative data from 14 wild chimpanzee (Pan spp.) populations are used to derive a set of equations defining the relationship between climatic variables and time budget components, which are then used to calculate the upper limits on group size that can be maintained in different habitats. We validate the model by showing that it correctly predicts the presence/absence of chimpanzees across sub-Saharan Africa and the group sizes observed in natural populations. The model suggests that the costs of travel are limiting for chimpanzees. Chimpanzees can reduce these costs dramatically by fissioning their bonded communities into small foraging parties.

  abstract = {Stereotypies often develop in environments that independent evidence shows cause poor welfare. Thus the development od stereotypies indicates that well-being has probably been poor, with the animal motivated to show a behaviour pattern that it could not perform normally or to completion. The continued performance of stereotypies may also indicate current suffering. However, an individual or population's degree of stereotypy does not necessarily correspond to the degree to which its well-being or welfare is impaired. This would require individual differences in stereotypy level to be the product of motivational differences and nothing else. In fact, they are also likely to be influenced by an animal's tendency to respond to the eliciting aspects of its environment with active behaviour rather than in a more inactive way. Stereotypy levels are also likely to be influenced by the general propensity of the individual to develop inflexible behavioural routines. Furthermore, as a stereotypy develops and becomes more habit-like it may be performed in circumstances where well-being is not at stake. Thus when comparing animals, lower levels of stereotypy do not necessarily reflect better well-being. General rules about the levels of stereotypy that are deemed ``acceptable'' from a welfare point of view are of limited use in reducing animal suffering unless they take take these factors into account. There is a great need for more research into the developmental processes responsible for stereotypies.},

  abstract = {Stereotypies are repetitive, invariant behaviour patterns with no obvious goal or function. They seem to be restricted to captive animals, mentally ill or handicapped humans, and subjects given stimulant drugs. In this respect they are abnormal, although possibly the product of normal behavioural processes. Stereotypies are often associated with past or present sub-optimal aspects of the environment, and have been used as a welfare indicator. It has been hypothesized that stereotypies have beneficial consequences which reinforce their performance, although other means, such as positive feedback, may equally explain their persistence. Empirical evidence links them with lowered awareness of external events, and reduced arousal and distress. However, as most of this evidence is correlational it remains uncertain that the stereotypies are themselves the cause of coping. Furthermore, they are heterogeneous in source of origin, proximate causation and physical characteristics, and they change over time in important respects, becoming more readily elicited by a wider range of circumstances. Therefore the properties of one stereotypy are not necessarily those of another.},

  abstract = {The effects of age and context on the stereotypies of caged mink were examined in order to assess the developmental changes undergone by the behaviour, and to find context-specificity that might suggest its motivational bases. Caged mink perform stereotypies consisting of a variety of movements, most commonly pacing and rearing, running in and out of the nestbox, and stationary head-twirling or nodding. Stereotypies are largely performed as feeding-time approaches, and many mink do not show them at all once fed. Stereotypies become more frequent and less variable with age; and in adults, individuals with the highest levels of stereotypy show the least variable forms of the behaviour and are most likely to perform it in more than one context, i.e. not solely in the pre-feeding period. These data suggest that mink stereotypies become 'established' with age, in the manner described for stereotypies in other species. However, the behaviour of kits does not follow the pattern seen in adults: kits performing stereotypies in more than one context do not have particularly high levels of the behaviour, nor are their stereotypies particularly unvarying. In addition, post-feeding stereotypies are commonly shown even by very young animals. Thus it cannot be the case that mink stereotypies are performed first in the pre-feeding situation and only later in other contexts via a process of emancipation. This conclusion is further supported by the finding that the forms of the behaviour often differ pre- and post-feeding. The specific forms and contexts of mink stereotypies suggest certain motivational bases for the behaviour. The rise in stereotypies as feeding time approaches and the sustained levels seen when the animals are not fed indicate hunger as an important factor, and in one dataset, the individuals whose stereotypies were solely pre-feeding used the most Longitudinal movements (i.e. pacing and its variants). This suggests that stereotypies, and pacing movements in particular, may stem from appetitive, food-searching behaviour. In contrast, Stationary movements such as head-twirling are performed more in the hours after feeding, and in one group of mink their levels declined over the pre-feeding period as feeding time approached. The physical appearance of such movements suggests they might be derived from attempts to escape the cage. Thus mink stereotypies are probably seen in a range of contexts because they develop from several different behaviour patterns, with different motivational bases. The link, in adults, between performance in this range of contexts and the degree of establishment of the behaviour may be explained in one of two ways. In one adult group the data suggest that animals with stereotypy in more than one context incorporate the typically post-feeding Stationary movements into their pre-feeding behaviour, as if emancipation of this movement had occurred. However, data from the other adult group do not support this hypothesis, and the degree of establishment and the number of contexts in which stereotypies are performed may not be causally linked at all, but instead the independent products of individual propensities to develop stereotypic behaviour. Sex and site differences have yet to be fully explained. Females show consistently higher levels of stereotypy than males, as if perhaps they find the environment more frustrating. There are also enormous differences in the frequency and incidence of the behaviour on the two different sites studied.}

  abstract = {This paper summarises recent findings on the causation of stereotypic behaviours and other abnormal repetitive behaviours (ARBs) in captive animals: primarily motivational frustration and/or brain dysfunction, with possible contributory roles also being played by habit-formation and `coping' effects. We then review the extent to which ARBs occur in zoos and similar, estimating that at least 10000 captive wild animals are affected worldwide. We argue for `zero tolerance' of such ARBs, because stress and poor welfare raise ethical issues, while abnormal behavioural phenotypes and possibilities of impaired brain development challenge both the indirect (e.g. educational) and the direct, intrinsic conservation value of affected animals. We then consider five potential means by which ARBs may be tackled: genetic selection; pharmacological treatment; the reinforcement of alternative behaviours; punishment; and environmental enrichment. All except punishment have potentially useful roles to play, but enrichment is the preferred approach: it is most likely to tackle the problems underlying stereotypic behaviours, and thence to improve both welfare and behaviour with few unwanted side-effects. Nevertheless, in zoos, environmental enrichment to date has only had partial success, with no study managing to abolish ARBs in all its subjects---suggesting either that the enrichments currently being used are never quite optimal, or that by the time they are tackled, ARBs have become resistant to change. We suggest some ways in which the effectiveness of enrichments may be enhanced; propose that certain properties of ARBs may usefully help evaluate their likely `treatability'; and emphasise that if improving welfare is more important than just reducing ARB, then additional measures are needed in order to first, reliably identify those individuals most at risk from poor welfare, and then, to fully evaluate the welfare impact of enrichments. This paper also emphasises, with examples, the enormous potential value of zoo-derived data for helping understand how taxon, ecological niche, rearing history, and current housing together affect animals' responses to captivity.},

  abstract = {We estimate that stereotypies are currently displayed by over 85 million farm, laboratory and zoo animals worldwide. This paper investigates their reliability as welfare indicators, by surveying studies relating stereotypy to other welfare measures and by analysing the mechanisms underlying this behaviour. Where data exist, most (approximately 68\%) situations that cause/increase stereotypies also decrease welfare. Stereotypy-eliciting situations are thus likely to be poor for welfare, although exceptions exist. Within such an environment, however, most (approximately 60\%) accounts link individual stereotypy performance with improved welfare (cf approximately 20\% linking it with reduced welfare). Thus, in a sub-optimal environment, non-stereotyping or low-stereotyping individuals could well have the poorest welfare, although again exceptions exist. Examining the mechanisms underlying stereotypy performance, we discuss four processes that could account for these complex links between stereotypy and welfare. Beneficial consequences from performing the specific source-behaviour of the stereotypy (`do-it-yourself enrichment'), or arising from repetition per se (`mantra effects'), may ameliorate welfare in poor environments. In addition, stereotypies that have become centrally controlled (habit-like), or that arise from autistic-like changes in the control of all behaviour (perseveration), are likely to be unreliable indicators of current state because they can be elicited by, or persist in, circumstances that improve welfare. To refine the role of stereotypy in welfare assessment, we suggest the collection of specific additional data to reveal when any of these four processes is acting. Until such research increases our understanding, stereotypies should always be taken seriously as a warning sign of potential suffering, but never used as the sole index of welfare; non-stereotyping or low-stereotyping individuals should not be overlooked or assumed to be faring well; simple measures of frequency should not be used to compare stereotypies that differ in age, form, or the biological or experiential characteristics of the performing animal; enrichments that do not immediately reduce stereotypies should not be assumed failures with respect to welfare; and finally, stereotypies should not be reduced by means other than tackling their underlying motivations.},

We tested two hypotheses: (1) that weight change after capture and handling is related to the intensity of the trapping and handling regime, and (2) that weight change after an intensive handling regime is related to an individual's current pattern of energy expenditure. Trapped wood mice that were subjected to intensive handling (intensive stressor) lost more weight than did animals that were handled minimally (less intensive stressor), but this was not the case for bank voles. Patterns and factors related to body weight change in response to intensive handling also differed between the two species: heavier and non-breeding bank voles were more likely to lose weight, but this was not true for wood mice, and none of the factors we measured was found to affect weight loss in this species. Our results were broadly consistent with the predictions of the biological cost hypothesis. We discuss the limitations and benefits of weight loss as a measure of stress.},

  abstract = {The common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula), introduced from Australia about 150 years ago, has become a major pest threatening the native biota of New Zealand. It is also an important disease vector, acting as a wildlife reservoir of infection. Conventional methods of control have had little effect on reducing the national population, so there is a quest to find more effective and humane methods. This has led to an upsurge in research aimed at increasing our knowledge of the biology of this marsupial, with an attendant increase in requirements for access to colony-housed animals. Possums kept for research purposes have often been housed in individual cages, and several colonies have experienced high mortality rates. After capture, possums have shown inappetence, weight loss and a predisposition to infection, suggesting that this species is susceptible to post-capture stress. For our reproductive studies, research animals are only useful if maintained under conditions that ensure behavioural and physiological processes remain normal. We have adopted an `animal husbandry' approach for our possum colony, where social interaction and the ability to exhibit instinctive behaviour patterns are considered as important as adequate nutrition and housing. In this colony, group-housed possums show no signs of post-capture stress, and mortality rate has been less than one per cent (of {$>$} 600 animals housed to date). Virtually all possums gain weight over the first month of captivity. Procedures for monitoring, handling and the collection of data from these animals, are carried out with little apparent stress to either animals or staff.},

Thus, we assessed the influence of isosexual pair housing on the development of these behaviors, as well as the incidence of illness and injury, in young Orange-winged Amazon parrots (Amazona amazonica). Parrots (n=21) were parent raised to 6 months of age and then housed either singly or in isosexual pairs. All cages included inanimate enrichments that were changed regularly, and all parrots were handled regularly. Behavioral activity was recorded 0,3,6,9 and 12 months after the parrots were housed in the experimental cages, and responses (e.g. willingness to approach, tolerance to touch, flight distance) to familiar and strange human handlers and to novel objects introduced into the home cage were recorded periodically. Paired parrots used their enrichments more (GLM: F1,10=13.74; P=0.004), and spent less time screaming (F1,10=4.90; P=0.051), less time preening (F1,10=5.12; P=0.047), and less time inactive (F1,10=9.24; P{$<$}0.012) than singly housed parrots. Time spent climbing, walking and flying decreased in both groups during the study, but the decrease was greater in the singly housed parrots (F1,54=4.50; P=0.038). None of the paired parrots developed stereotypy by month 12, while 57\% of the singly housed parrots did. Responses to familiar handlers did not differ, but paired parrots responded increasingly significantly less fearfully and aggressively to unfamiliar handlers during the study than did singly housed parrots (F1,54=6.37; P=0.015). Latency to approach novel objects was significantly reduced in the paired group when the two birds were tested together (F2,15=7.69; P=0.005). No parrots in the single group sustained injuries while 21\% of the parrots in the paired condition experienced injuries, although none of these could be directly linked to intra-pair aggression. Rates of illness did not differ between the two groups. Isosexual pair housing resulted in a more active and diverse behavioral repertoire, eliminated the development of stereotypy and reduced fear responses to novel objects without imparting significant risk of illness and injury or jeopardizing the ability of parrots to relate positively with humans. Thus, it appears that pair housing can significantly improve environmental quality and positively affect the welfare of captive parrots.},

  abstract = {Abnormal repetitive behaviours (ARBs) are associated with past, or present, welfare problems and are common elements of the behavioural repertoire of some captive animals, including birds. Millions of birds from hundreds of species are held in various captive settings, yet most avian ARB research to-date focuses on just a handful of these. Therefore, our knowledge of ARBs and, by implication, welfare, of a taxonomically diverse range of avian species is poorly understood. The purpose of this review is to begin to address this by providing a useful overview of ARBs across captive avian species. Taking advantage of the research effort on well-studied species, we pool current findings relating to avian ARBs into a coherent framework, highlight gaps in understanding, and use this to give a reference point for future research in both these and other species. We adopt Tinbergen's `Four Questions' approach to comprehensively consider ARBs from each of his four perspectives. We begin with presenting studies on ARB development, describing how physiological predispositions and early-life housing and experiences impact ARB risk in later life. Next we outline internal causal triggers for ARBs, such as the effects of neurotransmitters, hormones, and dietary deficiencies, and discuss external, environmental triggers for ARBs. In the evolution section, we detail the influence of species' evolutionary history on ARB, and use findings from early molecular studies on laying hens to discuss heritability and genes associated with ARB. The benefits of using cross-species studies to determine underlying evolutionary drivers of ARBs are also illustrated with an example from Psittaciformes. In discussing ARB `function', we make two tentative suggestions for potential examples of ARB performance allowing a bird to cope, and also consider situations where ARB may be functionless. We then summarise, and discuss, these four interacting perspectives on avian ARBs. To finish, the benefits of Tinbergen's approach are shown in a worked example of an ARB in one species, demonstrating how this valuable framework leads to the most complete understanding of ARB. Thus, by utilising Tinbergen's Four Questions, our review provides a platform for future research on avian ARBs, to lead to a better understanding of ARBs in both well- and poorly-studied species, and to solutions/preventive measures to improve avian welfare.},

In contrast, although allopreening occurs in many avian species, we know little about its social functions. Our study addresses this issue by investigating allopreening in a broad comparative data set including six corvid and nine parrot species. We assessed whether rates of allopreening initiations, proportion of time spent allopreening, and the number of grooming partners in captive group-housed birds were comparable to patterns observed in captive chimpanzees and bonobos. While parrots and corvids were found to have similar rates of social grooming to bonobos and chimpanzees, Pan species dedicated significantly more time to social grooming. Animals in larger groups had more grooming partners, but when controlling for the number of potential partners, birds tended to have fewer grooming interaction partners than Pan species. We then investigated whether allopreening in parrots and corvids was predicted by behavioral markers of affiliative social bonds (close physical proximity, active feeding, and low levels of agonistic behavior). Results revealed that providing allopreening to a partner was significantly predicted by often being in close proximity, but not engagement in active feeding or agonistic behavior. We examined the region allopreened in a subset of species and found that preening a partner's head was predicted by both close physical proximity and active feeding, while body allopreening was only predicted by close physical proximity. Head preening may confer more hygienic benefits to recipients, and thus, may be more selectively provided to valued partners. Results support the hypothesis that allopreening in corvids and parrots helps maintain social bonds with an individual's most important social partners, showing some similarities to allogrooming in primates.},

In the last decades there has been a great improvement in poultry production based on the careful control of several aspects, among which nutrition and management (environment, health and rearing systems). Nowadays, the search for good welfare conditions is a global tendency in animal production; however issues surrounding farm animal welfare or well-being, such as definitions, measurements, interpretation, and perception, continue to be controversial. It is known that the result of a broiler not adequately housed is a direct loss in production which leads towards a thought that health, welfare and productivity are intimately connected. In the other hand hints are found in the observation of behavioral responses as well as vocalization, which may provide more precise assessment to welfare. This has been possible due to the use of information technology applied to the field of ethology as well as the multidisciplinary view of the problem.

Positive welfare goes a step further than the common welfare approach, supporting that a good life for animals is not only the alleviation of negative aspects, but also the promotion of positive affectivities. So, a sustainable management system for any livestock species should promote positive aspects in the lives of animals. Poultry is one of the species whose welfare is most impaired, and numerous concerns are raised by society. For all the above, we reviewed the positive welfare indicators that have been studied in livestock poultry and that can be used to promote positive effects and assess welfare for the most common species, i.e., broilers, laying hens, turkeys, ducks, geese, quails and ostriches. We analyzed the results categorized by species, discussed the connection of the indicators with sustainable management, and made proposals for future studies. Exploration and dustbathing have been extensively studied and seem most promising, especially in broilers and laying hens, followed by nesting and perching, and swimming for waterfowl. Qualitative behavioral assessment (QBA) is already applied in protocols for broilers and laying hens, but the results are not as promising due to the homogeneity of the flock and the difficulty in observations. Play has been studied mostly in broilers but is a behavior difficult to recognize and needs further understanding. The results are limited for all species, except broilers and laying hens.},

  abstract = {Living in large, stable social groups is often considered to favour the evolution of enhanced cognitive abilities, such as recognizing group members, tracking their social status and inferring relationships among them1-4. An individual's place in the social order can be learned through direct interactions with others, but conflicts can be time-consuming and even injurious. Because the number of possible pairwise interactions increases rapidly with group size, members of large social groups will benefit if they can make judgments about relationships on the basis of indirect evidence5. Transitive reasoning should therefore be particularly important for social individuals, allowing assessment of relationships from observations of interactions among others. Although a variety of studies have suggested that transitive inference may be used in social settings6-10, the phenomenon has not been demonstrated under controlled conditions in animals. Here we show that highly social pinyon jays (Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus) draw sophisticated inferences about their own dominance status relative to that of strangers that they have observed interacting with known individuals. These results directly demonstrate that animals use transitive inference in social settings and imply that such cognitive capabilities are widespread among social species.}

  abstract = {Stereotypic behaviours (SBs) are common in confined animals including captive Carnivora, which display diverse forms of SB: often whole-body movements (e.g. pacing), but also head-only movements (e.g. head twirling) and `scrabbling' (scratching at enclosure boundaries). Although often pooled together, emerging evidence indicates that SBs are heterogeneous, suggesting that subtypes differ in their causes, triggers, and consequently treatments. In mink, a model carnivore, scrabbling seems to be elicited by neighbouring conspecifics. We tested this hypothesis via three studies of 32 males (individually caged in rows and separated by solid partitions). Study 1 investigated whether neighbour proximity affects the location of any SBs, and Study 2, whether removing neighbours reduces any SBs. Results revealed that although mink typically avoided proximity to their neighbours, scrabbling was uniquely directed towards neighbours who were close to the shared cage partition. It was also the only SB significantly elevated by having all-male neighbours, and reduced by removing neighbours. Study 3 then investigated whether environmental enrichment, a standard SB treatment, would reduce or abolish different SBs equally, to assess whether scrabbling is simply easier to alleviate than other SBs. Enrichment reduced all SB subtypes, but logistic regressions revealed that the odds of complete abolition were higher for whole-body and head-only SBs than for scrabbling. Overall, these naturally solitary carnivores thus seem to avoid conspecific proximity, but they specifically direct their stereotypic scrabbling at neighbours; and their scrabbling is reduced by neighbour removal, while their whole-body and head-only SBs are instead better alleviated with enrichment. Understanding that carnivore SBs are heterogeneous in their triggers and most effective treatments may help zoos, breeding centres and mink farms improve the design of their enclosures and the efficacy of their enrichments.},

This work studied the effect of pairing methods on the welfare of the Red-Legged partridge kept in laying cages (4,500 cm2), a commonly hunted game species in Western Europe. Agonistic behavior and possible injuries caused by aggression were studied during the pairing and laying period in 2 types of couples: the forced type (n = 24), 1 male and 1 female randomly chosen and placed in the same cage, and the free type (n = 24), where the female had the opportunity to chose between 4 males, using the time spent by the female near each male as female choice parameter. Welfare of partridges was affected by pairing system, as aggressive behavior, divorces and injuries were observed in a higher rate in forced pairs (25\% of pairs did not finish the productive cycle) than in free pairs (16.6\%). In addition, more females were attacked in forced pairs, whereas in free pairs, the number of attacked males and mutual aggression was increased. Males tended to display more aggressive behavior than females, pecking mainly on the head and back of females. Although injuries were observed in a minor rate in free pairs, a higher mortality was reported in females compared with males from both free and forced pairs (6 females died in total). The poor welfare in a high percentage of laying pairs hampers the development of sustainable rearing methods for the species. Thus, farmers should consider avoiding forced pairing.},

Moreover, we will explicitly refer to welfare issues ``beyond the average'', thereby addressing problems that are not entirely covered by simply studying personality traits in animal welfare research. By combining two different fields, we hope to stimulate more theoretical and empirical work on this topic to find new ways of improving the welfare of animals in human hands even at the individual level.},

ARB can be categorized into 2 basic forms: those whose aim appears to be to compulsively reach an inappropriate goal and those whose performance is linked to an inappropriate motor function. Although the negative welfare connotations of ARBs are well known, the precise reason for their performance remains the subject of debate. As zoos move forward in collection planning and to gather more evidence on the biological needs of the species being kept, the idea that ARBs may be part of a coping function adds more weight to arguments that some species may not be suitable for the zoo at all. Modern-day definitions of animal welfare tell us to measure the well-being of the individual based on its attempts at coping with its immediate environment. A failure to cope, and hence performance of ARB, is an objective and measurable welfare metric that may highlight which species are appropriate for captivity. As conservation pressures on zoos mount, and the need to take in more captive-naive species increases, research on why captive wild animals develop ARB can be used to inform practice. In this article, we aim to review the welfare issues across 3 basic categories of zoo animal (mammals, birds, and ectothermic vertebrates) and critique how research into ARBs can be used by zoos to promote wild-type behavior patterns by providing biologically relevant management and husbandry regimes, which allow animals the key components of control and choice over what they do and how they do it.},

We discuss some of the issues with using automated methods to measure animal behaviour within the context of assessing animal welfare. Automated feeders (eg for dairy calves) can help measure the degree that animals are hungry and have potential to identify sick animals even in group housing. Such equipment is best used for longitudinal studies of individual animals rather than making comparisons between farms. Devices attached to animals (eg accelerometers or GPS devices) can help measure the activity levels of animals with a high degree of accuracy and can easily be transported between farms, making them best suited for welfare assessment at the group level. Automated image analysis has great potential to assess movement within groups of animals, but following individual animals can be difficult. The techniques have been validated against traditional methods (eg direct observation). The accuracy of measures taken automatically varies between methods but can be increased by combining measures. Technological developments have provided us with a variety of tools that can be used to monitor behaviour automatically, and these have great potential to improve our ability to monitor animal welfare indicators on-farm. However, it is important that methods be developed to measure a wider range of behaviour patterns. Animal welfare assessment schemes should not place undue emphasis on behavioural indicators solely on the basis that they can be monitored automatically.},

A test series consisted of 12 of these observation periods, one on each of 12 successive days. Several experiments were designed to examine factors which might tend to increase or decrease stereotypy frequencies. Cage size, duration of confinement, and the sex of the birds were found to exert no effect on stereotypy levels. Time of day did influence route-tracing frequencies, but this effect seemed related to a general daily activity rhythm. Opportunities for social interaction with other canaries did reduce stereotyping frequencies, although interaction with another species exerted no effect. It is suggested that changes in the levels of stereotyping can be effected by providing opportunities for alternative activity, but that the development of stereotypies results from factors related to early rearing conditions},

Intraindividual variability (IIV) refers to the short-term, unpredictable, reversible variation in behaviour that often occurs in this situation. Although individual differences in IIV have been well documented in humans, this topic has been virtually ignored by researchers studying other animals. Here, we review evidence from humans and animals that IIV can vary in important ways across individuals (e.g. as a function of age or prior experience) and that individual differences in IIV may be related to differences in performance. However, most statistical models currently used to study individual differences in behaviour in animals rely on the assumption that IIV does not vary across individuals. Using `boldness' data for hermit crabs, Pagurus bernhardus, and Ward's damselfish, Pomacentrus wardi, we show how to measure IIV when behaviour systematically changes over a series of observations (e.g. as a result of habituation), and how to avoid the adverse effects of censored data on estimates of IIV. After controlling for systematic changes in behaviour over time, we observed strong, significant individual differences in IIV in both species. That is, some individuals were much more predictable in the same situation than were others. We conclude by discussing proximate and ultimate factors that might have contributed to interindividual variation in IIV in these species, and the implications of our findings for methods currently used to study individual differences in behaviour in animals.},

To test this hypothesis, we measured and experimentally manipulated caching to evaluate its relationship with operant measures of self-control in pinyon jays (Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus). We found no correlation between caching and self-control at the individual level, and experimentally increasing caching did not influence self-control.

Environmental enrichment has emerged recently as the main husbandry tool for tackling this problem. An increasing number of research publications have attempted to evaluate the effectiveness of enrichment in reducing stereotypic behavior and to develop further concepts to explain how effective enrichment works. A review and meta-analysis of this literature indicates that enrichment is a successful technique for reducing stereotypic behavior in zoo animals. Enrichment was associated with significant reduction in stereotypy performance about 53\% of the time. Published enrichment and stereotypy research is lacking for most zoo species, with most studies on large, charismatic, and often endangered species, but it is unclear whether stereotypies are more prevalent in these species. In addition, problems with scientific methods and data presentation, quantitatively detailed in this work, severely limit the conclusions drawn from zoo research. Further understanding of what kinds of enrichment works and what doesn't will require greater attention to experimental design, sample size, statistical analysis, and better descriptions of enrichment properties and the form of stereotypy. We recommend that future studies focus on increasing sample size (e.g., through multi-institutional studies), appropriate repeated measures design (e.g., with multiple baseline and experimental phases), providing full statistical information about the behavioral changes observed (including standard error), and ultimately the development of a predictive science for enrichment, stereotypies, and wellbeing.

A total of 58 pens with approximately 500 broilers each (Ross 308), corresponding to a stocking density of 40 kg/m2, were used. A total of 8 treatment groups, of which 5 were enrichment treatments (roughage, vertical panels, straw bales, and elevated platforms at 5 and 30 cm) and 3 were standard resources manipulations [increased distances between feed and water (7 m and 3.5 m), stocking density reduced to 34 kg/m2, and 1 control group (1.5 m distance between feed and water and no enrichment objects)] were randomly assigned to each pen. At 35 D of age, 60 birds from each pen were assessed for gait, footpad dermatitis, hock burns, plumage cleanliness, presence of scratches, and leg deformities. Birds housed with 30 cm elevated platforms had worse gait compared to those housed with straw bales and at the lower stocking density of 34 kg/m2 (P = 0.004 and P = 0.001). Broilers from the control group also had worse gait compared to those housed at 34 kg/m2 stocking density. In addition, birds housed with access to a 30 cm elevated platform had healthier footpads compared to birds housed with access to straw bales (P = 0.0001) and with increased distance between feed and water (P = 0.011). Furthermore, birds housed with straw bales had worse footpad condition compared to birds with access to a 5 cm elevated platform (P = 0.002). There were no observed treatment effects on scratches, plumage cleanliness, leg deformities and body weight (P {$>$} 0.05). Based on the welfare indicators used in the present study, decreased stocking density has the potential of improving animal welfare, whereas the effects of elevated platforms need to be further studied before a final conclusion can be drawn, as footpad health was positively affected, but walking ability was impaired.},

Here, we examined whether pinyon jays, a highly social corvid, use information from the social environment to modify their caching behavior. Pinyon jays were provided with pine seeds to cache in two visually distinct trays. The cacher could be observed by a non-pilfering conspecific, a pilfering conspecific, or an inanimate heterospecific located in an adjoining cage compartment, or the cacher could be alone. After caching, the pilfered tray was placed in the adjoining compartment where caches were either pilfered (pilfering conspecific and inanimate heterospecific conditions) or remained intact (non-pilfering conspecific and alone conditions). The safe tray was placed in a visible, but inaccessible, location. Overall, pinyon jays reduced the number of pine seeds cached in the pilfered tray when observed, compared with caching alone. However, their caching behavior did not differ between the pilfering conspecific and the non-pilfering conspecific conditions. These results suggest that either pinyon jays were unable to discriminate between the pilfering and non-pilfering conspecifics, or they generalized their experience of risk from the pilfering conspecific to the non-pilfering conspecific. Thus, we report evidence that pinyon jays use cache protection strategies to secure their resources when observed, but respond similarly when observed by pilfering and non-pilfering conspecifics.},

Our AEC has worked with a research group to ensure improved outcomes for captive wild birds in a specific study as well as for future studies. This involved the redesign of an outdoor aviary for the latest cohort of birds (n=8). The re-design includes 8 individual aviaries with sufficient space to allow flight for small birds ({$<$}150 g). The birds have been taught to feed in smaller cages within the aviaries so that they are easily re-caught and can be handled for the research. The capacity to reduce the aviary size for trial participation has also been incorporated, allowing researchers to conduct experiments with minimal handling of the birds. Current occupants (Silvereyes, {\textasciitilde}10 g) appear to have adapted well. The AEC has also endeavoured to set some guidelines for the time space between the various components of the research so that the birds are provided with time frames free from research interaction in the aviaries. The student researcher has been proactive in including remote monitoring through cameras as well as through nearby windows, and has recently implemented a remote design to close the smaller cages. This session will discuss the process and evaluate its outcomes to date.},

  abstract = {In the field of psychology, the practice ofp value null-hypothesis testing is as widespread as ever. Despite this popularity, or perhaps because of it, most psychologists are not aware of the statistical peculiarities of thep value procedure. In particular,p values are based on data that were never observed, and these hypothetical data are themselves influenced by subjective intentions. Moreover,p values do not quantify statistical evidence. This article reviews thesep value problems and illustrates each problem with concrete examples. The three problems are familiar to statisticians but may be new to psychologists. A practical solution to thesep value problems is to adopt a model selection perspective and use the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) for statistical inference (Raftery, 1995). The BIC provides an approximation to a Bayesian hypothesis test, does not require the specification of priors, and can be easily calculated from SPSS output.},

This is unfortunate, as the p-value provides at best a rough estimate of the evidence that the data provide for the presence of an experimental effect. An alternative and arguably more appropriate measure of evidence is conveyed by a Bayesian hypothesis test, which prefers the model with the highest average likelihood. One of the main problems with this Bayesian hypothesis test, however, is that it often requires relatively sophisticated numerical methods for its computation. Here we draw attention to the Savage--Dickey density ratio method, a method that can be used to compute the result of a Bayesian hypothesis test for nested models and under certain plausible restrictions on the parameter priors. Practical examples demonstrate the method's validity, generality, and flexibility.},

In the present study, we investigated behavioral responses of captive common ravens, Corvus corax and crows, Corvus corone, to the presence of visitors in general and to the proximity or distance of visitors to the aviary respectively. Duration of affiliative behaviors, feeding and stress-related behaviors did not change when visitors were present compared to control situations without visitors being present. Both corvid species showed less head up behavior when visitors were in sight compared to the control condition. In contrast, preening of crows significantly increased when visitors were within two meters of the aviary compared to the control condition. The same relationship was found in regard to increase in vocalization for common ravens, but not for crows. Our results indicate that corvids, housed in a wildlife park for several years, still show behavioral responses to the presence of human visitors in close proximity to their enclosure. Overall, we did not find clear indications for reduced welfare due to visitor presence, such as increased locomotion or stress-related behaviors. We therefore conclude that the described behavioral changes are not indicative of any negative welfare impacts of visitor presence.}

We review technology currently being applied in studies of zoo, farm and laboratory animals to regularly monitor welfare status, as well as to evaluate responses to particular stimuli and situations. In terms of behavioural measures, we focus on automated assessments that offer insight into how animals --- even those that are nocturnal or elusive --- behave when humans are not present. Specifically, we provide an overview of how animal-attached technology (accelerometers, global positioning systems, radio frequency identification systems) can be implemented to generate activity budgets, examine use of space, conduct gait assessments, determine rates of movement and study social dynamics. We also emphasise the value of bioacoustics, as the rate and acoustic structure of certain vocalisations may vary across contexts and reflect an animal's internal state. While it can be challenging to identify non-invasive methods for investigating physiological welfare indicators, we discuss approaches (thermography, tracking measures of heart rate) that may be especially useful for monitoring affective states and psychophysiological functioning. Finally, we make a concerted effort to highlight tools that allow welfare scientists to consider measures of positive welfare. Ultimately, zoos can ensure that each animal has the opportunity to thrive by employing technology to create baseline behavioural and physiological profiles, conduct ongoing monitoring schemes and assess responses to specific conditions, events and stimuli.},

  abstract = {The psychological and physiological effects of different genres of music are well documented in humans. These concepts have also been studied in kenneled dogs and some exotic animals, implying that animals may experience benefits similar to those of humans. This study tested the hypothesis that auditory enrichment changed the behavior of ten zoo-housed psittacines. All animals were exposed to six conditions of auditory stimulation; a `control' (no auditory stimulation), and `experimental' conditions, during which animals were presented with commercially-available CDs of classical music, pop music, natural rainforest sounds, parrot sounds and a talking radio. Each type of stimulation lasted two days, with a wash-out day between different stimulation conditions. We recorded key parameters relating to the birds' social environment -- whether they were group or single-housed and whether they had been hand or parent-reared. The parrots' behaviour was recorded every minute for a 25min period seven times a day using instantaneous sampling. The incidence of calm vocalisations and the level of preening changed with the different conditions. Birds exposed to rainforest and talking radio preened more than control birds. Birds exposed to several genres of auditory stimulation expressed fewer calm vocalisations than control birds. A further finding from this study was that hand-reared birds exhibited dramatically increased incidences of stereotypic behavior, more learned vocalisation and interacted less with enrichment than parent-reared and the implications of hand rearing for welfare are discussed. Similarly solo housed birds showed changes in behavior compared to group housed, such as less preening and more stereotypic behaviour. Hand reared, solo housed parrots express less normal behavior and maybe at risk of impaired welfare.},

To monitor improvements made to elephant welfare in UK zoos, non-invasive, valid and reliable indicators of welfare are needed. Using a rapid review strategy and critical appraisal tool, we aimed to appraise evidence from peer-reviewed literature on potential welfare indicators for captive elephants. Scopus, Web of Knowledge and Ovid were searched in January 2014 using terms relevant to captive elephants and welfare assessment. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied and remaining articles were critically appraised against a specially designed welfare indicator appraisal tool. Thirty-seven unique indicators of welfare were extracted from 30 peer-reviewed papers which met the inclusion criteria. Behavioural measures of welfare (n = 21) were more common than either physical (n = 11) or physiological (n = 5) measures. Stereotypies were the most frequently used behavioural measure, glucocorticoids were the most frequently used physiological measure and body condition scores were the most frequently used physical measure. There was most support for the following indicators of improved welfare state: reduced stereotypies, reduced glucocorticoids and improved body condition scores. Additional measures which require further validation but had strong associations with the most supported measures, and thus have potential use in welfare assessment, were: increased lying rest and positive social interactions. Further validation of the described measures is needed, but this information forms a crucial part of the knowledge required to efficiently monitor and improve the welfare of elephants in captivity.},

Stereotypies, or repetitive behaviors that have no apparent function or goal, are performed by animals experiencing poor conditions in their environment and indicate welfare concerns. Changes in the housing environment in particular may have critical influences on behavior and welfare. Here, we measured behavioral changes in a captive pinyon jay (Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus) population (n = 12) associated with a shift from single to pair housing. Using automated video processing, we show that pair housing greatly reduced overall activity levels in these birds. The stark reduction in activity was surprising, as we expected that social housing would increase interactions between birds, thus increasing activity levels. Upon further analysis, however, we found that stereotypic behaviors like beak scraping, jumping, pecking, and route tracing decreased after pair housing, whereas a calming behavior---preening---increased. Our results indicate that pair housing may reduce overall activity in pinyon jays; however, this reduction is primarily in stereotypic behaviors.},

Specifically, the review includes an overview of research on different topics and a summary of key findings across nine resources that affect bird welfare. We also highlight areas where additional research is necessary. Future welfare research in zoos and aquariums should prioritize studies that consider a diversity of bird species across topics and work to identify animal-based measures with empirical evidence.

All 24 individuals developed wire-gnawing after weaning at 20 d of age. In ICR one female and in NU five males and three females additionally developed jumping. ICR developed wire-gnawing between the age of 20 and 30 d, in NU jumping started at the age of 20 d, but intense jumping and wire-gnawing comparable to that of ICR did not develop in NU before the age of 40--50 d. Within each strain there was no significant difference between males and females with respect to the development of stereotypic behaviour. By contrast, ICR showed significantly more wire-gnawing but less jumping than NU. Stereotypy level increased with age up to a mean of 10.7 \% of total activity in ICR and up to 7.4 \% in NU at 100 d of age. However, there was huge inter- and intra-individual variability with respect to all parameters assessed in this study, i.e. total duration, number of bouts and bout length of the two stereotyped patterns. Wire-gnawing developed from outside-directed explorative climbing at the cage lid, whereas the source behaviour pattern (Mason 1991 a, Anim. Behav. 41, 1015--1037) of jumping was outside-directed explorative rearing at the cage wall. At 20 d of age, before the onset of stereotypy development, ICR showed significantly more climbing but less rearing than NU. Physical retardation of NU at weaning may account for decreased climbing ability during early ontogeny, and hence for the retarded development of wire-gnawing. The difference in early experience with either of the two patterns rather than genetic effects may be responsible for the qualitative difference between the strains with respect to the form of later stereotypy.},
